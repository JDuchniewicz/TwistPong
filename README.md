# TwistPong
It is a small 2D game made using SFML C++ library, it is first my project using pure C++ thus it is quite simple but has potential to growth
It is mostly programmed using Object Oriented Paradigm, but using shallow inheritance.

As for now I am writing first mode and creating physics collision systems. Soon adding some UI and AI scripting

Game rules:
* There are few modes
  + Player vs AI
  + Player vs Player
  + 2 vs 2 Players
* Object of the game is similar to the oldschool Pong game

As for now the game looks like this:
